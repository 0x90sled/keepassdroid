Build instructions:
1. Arrange the build tree so that it is laid out as follows:
  a. mkdir ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid
  b. mkdir ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid/project
  c. Move the KeePassDroid git root to ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid/project
  d. cp -a ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid/project/jni_root ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid

2. Run prep-build.sh from ${ndk-root}/apps/KeePassDroid to download, unpack, and patch the openssl sources.

3. At ${ndk-root} run 'make APP=KeePassDroid' to build the native sources.
